## Is there any prebuilt checklist for my "aircraft-make-model"?


No there is not. You need to build your own. You can find a guide on how to build a checklist for yourself here: https://checklist.tabbythecat.com/how-to/
and also you can ask for help to find a checklist for your aircraft on Discord channel.
